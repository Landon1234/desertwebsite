    <p>I picked the desert to tie in the cell parts to plants or
        living things because I am familiar with what lives and grows
        in the desert. I also found it interesting that even though
        there aren't very many plants in the desert that grow, the
        plants that do grow use methods similar to the methods that
        a cell uses.</p>
